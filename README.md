---------------------------------------------

Rules:
- Make your submission as a pull request to the this repository.
- The pull request must contain the code used to make the picture, as well as a screenshot in the description.
- You can make as many submissions as you want.
- The competition will run until the end of October, after which all pull requests will be merged.
- The pull request with the most positive emojis at the end of the competition wins.

I will personally make sure that the winner receives a framed picture of their submission as well as an empty bottle of wine with the label SAP Product Engineering, which I unfortunately drank before I got this idea.
