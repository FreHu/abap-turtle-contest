# abap-turtle-contest

https://blogs.sap.com/2019/10/12/abapturtle-make-something-pretty-in-abap-and-possibly-win-prizes/

Rules:
- Make your submission as a pull request to the this repository. 
- You can make as many submissions as you want.
- The competition will run until the end of October, after which all pull requests will be merged.
- The pull request with the most positive emojis at the end of the competition wins.

I will personally make sure that the winner receives a framed picture of their submission as well as an empty bottle of wine with the label SAP Product Engineering, which I unfortunately drank before I got this idea.
